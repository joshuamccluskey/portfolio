      "description": "ðŸ‘‹  I'm Joshua McCluskey (he/him). Iâ€™m a software developer working out of Seattle.  For most of my career, I was an Airborne Cryptologic Language Analyst in the U.S. Air Force: learning languages and practicing electronic combat. I chose to leave the military and moved to Seattle in order to support my wifeâ€™s career in UX Design. My excitement for coding started while working as a federal procurement official for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. At the lab I was working at, I stumbled into a Google Developers meeting and was hooked. I learned JavaScript and Python in an effort to automate processes during remote work due to COVID-19. My deep interest in coding has pushed me to become proficient in C# and the .NET framework where I look forward to work with more in the future. I have a proven track record as a quick learner, and the military has distinguished and awarded numerous times based on my ability to quickly learn and execute solutions. My years of experience as a leader and seeker of answers and solutions has made me an invaluable asset to any crew or team Iâ€™ve been a part of.",
