### Reflections and Comments

It is still a work in progress, and I feel confident I can implement all the changes and updates. Most of my time was working on Netlify deployment and updating the README and minor changes to header. I spent approximately an 1:30 on this today. I spent most of my time troubleshooting my code challenge repo which had a corrupted file that broke my tests, I had to clone down epo multiple times r and figure it with Maria and Ryan to fix corrupt file and initialize app again to perform test.

### Reflections & Comments

Overall, I relied on pattern recognition to complete all tasks, and if I needed, I went to the docs to get a quick understanding how a portion of the code worked. I understand that pattern recognition is a technique to relie on when working in an unfamiliar code base. I really enjoyed learning from this lab.
